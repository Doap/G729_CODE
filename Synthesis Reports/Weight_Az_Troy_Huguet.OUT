WARNING:Xst:737 - Found 16-bit latch for signal <nextgamma>. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.

WARNING:Xst:737 - Found 16-bit latch for signal <add_a>. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.

WARNING:Xst:737 - Found 32-bit latch for signal <L_add_a>. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.

WARNING:Xst:737 - Found 16-bit latch for signal <L_mult_b>. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.
